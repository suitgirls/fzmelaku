            My name is Fraoli Zerihun Melaku. I an a rising junior in Ethiopia, Africa. I wanted to take this class because i wanted to explore the IT field in depth. I am interested in how smart watches and trackers work. I have a family of 6, i have a twin sister and two younger brothers. I also have an amazing mom and an exceptional dad. In my free time, i spend my time reading romance books and making memories with my friends and family.
